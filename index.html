<h2 id="background-of-report">Background of Report</h2>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Decker family
history, drawing from multiple primary sources including Charles E.
Stickney’s 1895 “History of Deckertown,” a detailed family tree diagram,
and three genealogical records. Together, these sources trace the Decker
family’s journey from their origins in Holland through their settlement
and expansion across America over nearly four centuries.</p>
<p>The Decker family’s American story begins with Johannes De Decker
(c. 1620), who helped negotiate New Amsterdam’s surrender in 1664, and
continues through multiple generations that shaped communities across
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida. This
report highlights how the Decker family networks influenced settlement
patterns, economic development, and community formation in early
America, with particular focus on the founding and growth of Deckertown
(now Sussex, New Jersey).</p>
<p>Through careful analysis of multiple sources, this report identifies
key family branches, documents significant historical events involving
family members, traces geographic movements, and establishes connections
between different generations. The result is a comprehensive
genealogical and historical account that places the Decker family within
the broader context of American history.</p>
<h2 id="i.-european-origins-and-early-american-settlement">I. European
Origins and Early American Settlement</h2>
<h3 id="european-roots">European Roots</h3>
<p>The Decker family’s American story begins in Holland. According to
genealogical records, the earliest known ancestor was Johannes De Decker
(c. 1620), who played a significant role in American colonial history by
helping negotiate New Amsterdam’s surrender in 1664 when the Dutch
colony was taken over by the British.</p>
<p>His son, Jan Gerritse(n) Decker, was born around 1640 in Heerden,
Gilderland, Holland (Netherlands) and emigrated to the American
colonies. Jan married Grietje Hendrisckse Westercamp on March 23, 1664,
in the Kingston (Wiltwyck) Reform Dutch Church in Ulster County, New
York. Grietje was born between 1642-1644 in New Amsterdam (later New
York).</p>
<p>Jan Gerritse(n) Decker established himself in the Kingston area,
appearing on the muster roll of the garrison at Wiltwyck (Kingston) in
1661. In 1663, he and his family faced hardship when they were taken
prisoner along with their three children. He appears in Kingston Church
records in 1688, 1697, and 1701, attended a trustees meeting in
Rochester in 1703, and was listed on the 1709 tax list of Ulster County.
He died before February 23, 1709, in Ulster County, NY.</p>
<h3 id="second-generation-in-america">Second Generation in America</h3>
<p>The second generation of Deckers in America included Hendrick Jansen
Decker, born around 1667 in Accord (Kingston), Rochester Township,
Ulster County, NY. Hendrick married twice: first to Jannetjen Kortright
and later to Antje (Hannah) Geertje Quick on December 18, 1696, in the
Kingston Reformed Dutch Church. Antje was born between 1668-1674 in
Kingston and died around 1717 in Port Jervis, Deerpark, Orange County,
NY. Their son Thomas was baptized on September 3, 1704.</p>
<p>Another important second-generation member was Jan Gerritse Decker
(b. July 28, 1688, Kingston, Ulster County, NY; d. Romney, Hampshire,
WV), whose parents were Gerrett Janse Decker (b. February 14, 1664) and
Margariet Grietjen Decker (b. about August 31, 1664). Jan married
Barbara Janes DeWitt (b. April 17, 1692). His migration from New York to
West Virginia demonstrates the family’s early westward movement.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-the-common-ancestor-and-diverging-branches">II. The Common
Ancestor and Diverging Branches</h2>
<p>The family tree identifies Johannis Decker (c. 1685) as a common
ancestor for the various branches of the Decker family in America.
Johannis was buried in Minisink, Orange County, NY. From this common
ancestor, three main branches of the family emerged:</p>
<h3 id="isaacs-line-moving-to-pennsylvania">Isaac’s Line (Moving to
Pennsylvania)</h3>
<p>One branch of the family, beginning with Major John Decker
(1712-1793), eventually migrated to Pennsylvania. This lineage continued
through Isaac Decker (1743-~1840), who married Dorcas Chamberlain
(~1750-). Isaac appears to be a pivotal figure connecting the New Jersey
and Pennsylvania branches. His long life (nearly 100 years) spans from
the colonial era through the early republic.</p>
<p>Isaac and Dorcas had several children, including: - Christopher
Decker (~1780-, b. in Cumberland Co., PA) - Daniel Decker (~1787-1840,
b. in Sussex Co., NJ, d. in Fairfield Twp, Westmoreland Co, PA)</p>
<p>The line continued through Jacob Decker (~1784-1835), who married
Elizabeth Irwin (~1785-). Jacob may have been Isaac’s son, representing
the transition of the family from New Jersey to Pennsylvania. Jacob and
Elizabeth had a son named Daniel Decker (1808-1887).</p>
<p>Daniel Decker (1808-1887) married Sara Martin (~1813-1885) and had
several children, including: - Charles Martin Decker (1835-1871) - Job
Decker (1837-1899) - Martin Decker (1841-1887) - James W. Decker
(1843-1865) - William A. Decker (b. ~1843) - John Decker (1844-&lt;1900)
- Chamberlin Decker (b. 1846)</p>
<p>Daniel lived and died in St. Clair Township, Westmoreland County, PA,
firmly establishing the Decker family in western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Job Decker (1837-1899) continued the line, fathering Samuel St. Clair
Decker (1865-1930), who married Anna Lide Sharpe (1866-1946). Samuel and
Anna had a son named Clifford J. Decker (1896-), who lived in
Pittsburgh, PA and married Anna Carbaugh (~1891-).</p>
<p>Clifford J. Decker and Anna had a son named Clifford Decker (1915-),
who married Marjorie (~1919-) and had three sons (b. ~1950). Clifford
died in Gainesville, FL, representing the family’s geographic expansion
to Florida in the mid-20th century.</p>
<h3 id="peters-line-remaining-in-new-jersey">Peter’s Line (Remaining in
New Jersey)</h3>
<p>The second branch, which is more directly connected to the founding
and development of Deckertown, remained in New Jersey. This lineage
included: - Peter Decker (1711-?), buried in Sussex County, NJ (likely
Clove Cemetery) - Peter Decker (Landowner), buried in Sussex County, NJ
(likely Old Clove Cemetery) - Josiah Decker (1740-1814), buried in Clove
Cemetery, Sussex County, NJ - Bowdewine Decker (1763-1853), buried in
Old Clove Church Cemetery, Sussex County, NJ - Samuel Decker (1790-?),
possibly buried in Clove Cemetery, NJ - William B. Decker (1825-1861),
buried in Clove Cemetery, Sussex County, NJ - Chester Edward Decker
Sr. (1926-2023), buried in Clove Cemetery, Sussex County, NJ</p>
<h3 id="tobias-decker-line-west-virginia-frontier">Tobias Decker Line
(West Virginia Frontier)</h3>
<p>Another significant branch was established by Tobias Decker, who died
on October 16, 1759, during an Indian attack. Tobias had brothers named
Garrett and John Decker. This family settled in Monongalia County, WV in
1758, representing the frontier experience of the Decker family.</p>
<p>Tobias and his brothers were among 11 riflemen with Braddock’s Army
who lost their way after the Battle of Monongahela during the
French-Indian War (1754-55). After the battle, they settled near what is
now Morgantown, WV. Tragically, Tobias, his wife, and two children were
killed in a 1759 attack by Delaware Indians on the Decker’s Creek
settlement.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-the-founding-and-development-of-deckertown">III. The
Founding and Development of Deckertown</h2>
<h3 id="peter-decker-the-founder">Peter Decker: The Founder</h3>
<p>According to Stickney’s “History of Deckertown,” Peter Decker was the
founder of what would become Deckertown. He and his wife Magdalena (née
Isterbout) were described as “sturdy American born Hollanders” whose
original German names were Petrus and Lecentje Decker. Peter cleared the
virgin soil and established the first homestead in what would later
become the town center.</p>
<p>The settlement was initially called “Deckerville” after the founding
family and began as a small collection of log houses in the wilderness.
Peter’s sons who settled around him in Deckertown were Samuel, Pope, and
Hick, and they had daughters named Hannah, Maria, Catherina, Annetje,
and Rebecca.</p>
<p>By 1895, when Stickney wrote his history, approximately eight-tenths
of the inhabitants of Deckertown were related by blood or marriage to
Peter and Magdalena Decker, demonstrating the profound influence this
family had on the community’s development.</p>
<h3 id="early-settlement-context">Early Settlement Context</h3>
<p>The early development of Deckertown was influenced by broader
colonial patterns. The Minisink patent of 1702, issued by Queen Anne,
conveyed lands from the lower end of Big Minisink Island northeast in
New Jersey to certain parties, setting the stage for settlement disputes
that would continue for decades.</p>
<p>The settlement’s growth was also shaped by its relationship with
indigenous peoples, particularly the Munsey Indians (also called
Munsies), whose tribal emblem or totem was a wolf that served as their
signature and was recognized by other Indian tribes throughout the
region.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-and-economic-development">Infrastructure and
Economic Development</h3>
<p>The physical development of Deckertown is chronicled in Stickney’s
history. Andrew Willson built the first frame house in the neighborhood
around the end of the Revolutionary War, followed by Peter Decker
building his own frame house around the same time. Early roads were
developed, including one that was later straightened in 1817 when the
Hoboken and Milford turnpike was constructed.</p>
<p>Economic activities in early Deckertown included the manufacture of
potash, with Robert Morris Jr. specifically noted as being involved in
this industry in 1772. The presence of a cider house and distillery,
mentioned in a foreclosure action, suggests diversification of economic
activities as the settlement grew.</p>
<h3 id="land-ownership-and-property-development">Land Ownership and
Property Development</h3>
<p>The division of Peter Decker’s original land holdings into the many
small parcels that later comprised Deckertown is described by Stickney
as a process that cannot be followed in detail, but he notes that
various speculators suffered losses in their dealings. The text suggests
that Peter Decker never received the full reward he deserved for his
preemption rights.</p>
<p>The family tree diagram notes several important land transactions
involving the Decker family: - Peter Decker (Landowner) owned land
surveyed for Richard Penn - Peter Decker sold part of Richard Penn land
to Joseph Sharp (1813) - Samuel Decker (1790) sold land to Bowdewine
Decker (1790) - Bowdewine Decker purchased land from Samuel Decker
(1790)</p>
<p>A significant foreclosure action resulted in the Sheriff selling the
cider house, distillery lots, and several other parcels of land in
Deckertown. Bowdewine Decker was the purchaser, as recorded in a deed
dated April 9, 1827. Seven or eight years later, Samuel Whittaker,
William Rankin, and John Loomis bought large portions of the real
estate, followed by Jacob E. Hornbeck, reflecting the changing patterns
of land ownership as the town developed.</p>
<h2 id="iv.-the-decker-family-in-american-history">IV. The Decker Family
in American History</h2>
<h3 id="revolutionary-war-service">Revolutionary War Service</h3>
<p>The Decker family played a role in the American Revolution, with
several family members serving in the Continental Army. The genealogical
records mention several Decker family members who served in the
Revolutionary War, including Abraham Decker, Benjamin Decker, Conrad
Decker, George Decker, Isaac Decker, Jacob Decker, Jacob C. Decker, John
Decker, and Lawrence L. Decker.</p>
<p>A letter from Revolutionary War veteran and pensioner George/Joris
Decker describes his service, including being marched to the Delaware
River on the frontiers in New York, then to North River to Stony Point,
and later being drafted for a 9-month tour before the Battle of Long
Island.</p>
<h3 id="french-indian-war-and-frontier-conflicts">French-Indian War and
Frontier Conflicts</h3>
<p>The Decker family was also involved in the French-Indian War
(1754-55). Tobias and Garrett Decker were among 11 riflemen with
Braddock’s Army who, after the Battle of Monongahela, settled near what
is now Morgantown, WV.</p>
<p>The frontier experience of the Decker family is dramatically
illustrated by the 1759 attack on the Decker’s Creek settlement by
Delaware Indians, which resulted in the deaths of Tobias Decker, his
wife, and two children, along with other settlers. This tragic event
highlights the dangers faced by frontier settlers during this
period.</p>
<p>From historical accounts: “On the afternoon of Oct 16, 1759 the
settlement was attacked by about 30 Delaware Indians who murdered 8
persons, killed the livestock, burned the cabins and destroyed the
crops. They captured Abel Westfall, took him to Fort Duquesne then to an
Indian town in Ohio. 39 men &amp; women were away from the settlement at
the time. Those killed were Tobias Decker, his wife and two children;
William Zern and wife; Abel Westfall’s wife and son.”</p>
<h3 id="boundary-disputes">Boundary Disputes</h3>
<p>Boundary disputes between New York and New Jersey significantly
affected the region’s development. When Sussex County was organized in
1853 after being cut from Morris County, disputes between New York and
New Jersey claimants to lands along the boundary line were at their
height. New York State had been exercising authority and collecting
taxes over lands that would later be included in New Jersey, while New
Jersey Proprietors claimed that the boundary line should run from the
Hudson River in a straight line to the northernmost branch of the
Delaware River, which would have reached Cochecton. This would have
placed Port Jervis and surrounding lands within New Jersey, leading to
disputes, writs of ejectment, and “lively times along the border.”</p>
<h2 id="v.-geographic-expansion-of-the-decker-family">V. Geographic

<h2 id="viii.-conclusion">VIII. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The comprehensive analysis of the Decker family history reveals a
family deeply intertwined with the development of early America. From
their origins in Holland to their settlement and expansion across New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and beyond, the Deckers
exemplify the American immigrant experience and the nation’s westward
expansion.</p>
<p>The family’s involvement in significant historical events—from the
surrender of New Amsterdam to the French-Indian War, the Revolutionary
War, and frontier conflicts—places them at the center of America’s
formative experiences. Their founding and development of Deckertown
demonstrates how family networks influenced community formation and
economic development in early America.</p>
<p>The detailed genealogical information now available provides a
comprehensive understanding of the Decker family’s branches, movements,
and contributions to American history. This integrated history serves as
a valuable resource for understanding not just one family’s journey, but
the broader patterns of settlement, conflict, and community-building
that shaped the American experience.</p>
